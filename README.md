# eggbot
a drawing machine using eggs as a canvas

This is a project that started in with a build about 10 years ago.
So in this repository you will find a section of old reference files, of which I can not guarantee that they are still functional. But I rather include them to let you wander around to discover what is our there.
I know that a lot of the software will no longere be functional and needs an update, but I'd liked to keep them here as a reference to what was used 10+ years ago

The new build we are attempting in 2025 will be in the top level. 
It will be structured in the several technices we are going to use, CAD-model, 3D-print, laser cutting, PCB design, PCB assembling, ...

If there is any suggestion to organize it differently please let me know


## original project

this project is a make over of the [Eval Mad Scientists](https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/766) eggbot project. All credits go to them as the originators of the ideas. (https://hackaday.com/2019/04/17/what-can-you-learn-from-an-eggbot/)
